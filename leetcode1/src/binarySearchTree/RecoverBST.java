Problem:    Recover Binary Search Tree
Difficulty: High
Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/
Notes:
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
Recover the tree without changing its structure.
Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
Solution: 1. recursive solution. O(n) space. get inorder list first.
          2. recursive solution. O(n) space. with only auxiliary two pointers.
          3. Use a stack. Iteration.
          4. Morris inorder traversal. O(1) space. with only auxiliary two pointers.
